# Modern LLM Study Group Resources

This repository is for the fastai Modern LLM paper reading study group. Here you can find the papers we covered along with any extra resources.

We are working our way through the seminal LLM papers starting with the GPT-3 paper, [*Language Models are Few-Shot Learners*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165).

The plan is to read our way through all the modern LLM methods mentioned by Andrej Karpathy in his [*The State of GPT*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A) talk, along with any new developments since then.

The study group is coordinated through the [fastai discord](https://forums.fast.ai/t/discord-live-coding-details/75370) in the #cluster-of-stars text channel and currently meets weekly on Fridays at 2300 UTC (7pm Eastern) in the #fastai-study-groups voice channel.

## LLM Paper Reading List
