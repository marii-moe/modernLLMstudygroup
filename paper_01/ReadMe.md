# Language Models are Few-Shot Learners

We will be working our way through the seminal LLM papers starting with the GPT-3 paper, [*Language Models are Few-Shot Learners*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). Please read *Language Models are Few-Shot Learners* in its entirety

The plan is to eventually read our way through all the modern LLM methods mentioned by Andrej Karpathy in his [*The State of GPT*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A) talk, along with any new developments since then.
