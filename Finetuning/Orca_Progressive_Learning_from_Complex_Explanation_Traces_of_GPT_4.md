 # Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4

Next week we will be reading "[Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)". Orca learns from sythetic data created using GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought processes; and other complex instructions. 

Further Reading:
 * Orca 2- includes improvements to orca including task specific system prompts and sometimes erasing the system prompt([arxiv.org/abs/2311.11045](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11045))
 * Open-Hermes- Inspired by Orca, dataset was created here ([huggingface.co/datasets/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5](https://huggingface.co/datasets/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5)) Organization ([huggingface.co/NousResearch](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch)), some inspiration for anyone getting started in deep learning ([twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1741638013481091369](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1741638013481091369)) 
 * Orca-Math- Uses techniques similar to Orca1, but also multi-agent and iterative learning techniques to generate a dataset. This dataset on huggingface (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14830)
 * LIMA- provides a nice small finetuning dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206)
