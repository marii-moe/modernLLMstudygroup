# How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs

this week's paper is [*How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09668). This paper leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs to directly assess the quality of training examples in addition to density sampling to create a diverse corpus.
