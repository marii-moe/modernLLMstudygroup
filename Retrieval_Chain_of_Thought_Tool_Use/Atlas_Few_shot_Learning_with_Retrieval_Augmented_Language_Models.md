# Atlas: Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models

This week's paper is the second in the a series on Retrieval Augmented LLMs. [*Atlas: Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03299) pretrains and finetunes both the retrieval and LM backbone models end-to-end.
