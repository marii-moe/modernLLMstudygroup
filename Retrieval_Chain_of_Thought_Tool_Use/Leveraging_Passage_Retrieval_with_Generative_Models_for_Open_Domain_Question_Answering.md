# Leveraging Passage Retrieval with Generative Models for Open Domain Question Answering

This week's paper is the first of a series on Retrieval Augmented LLMs. [*Leveraging Passage Retrieval with Generative Models for Open Domain Question Answering*](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.74/), the Fusion-in-Decoder paper, finetunes the LM backbone with retrieval context.
